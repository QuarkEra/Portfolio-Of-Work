        <h1 class="Headline">JavaScript ChatBot for Twitch.tv</h1>
        <p>Looking for more interactive and functional programming I looked into coding a chat bot I could test in real time on my machine and which could be used for sincere purposes as well as entertainment.</p>
        <div class="columns">
            <div class="col">
                <h2 class="card-title">Description</h2>
                <p class="caption">
                    This was my first interactive code featuring functions I wrote - and have since forgotten and rediscovered. There is something wholesome about seeing one's old code.

        <h3>Things I Learned</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>An API has documentation that put me to shame.</li>
            <li>Some features were out of my league or superfluous.</li>
            <li>Chat bots are often wasteful or made for the ego.</li>
            <li>Chat bots can be very helpful for logging stats on channel activity.</li>
        </ul>
