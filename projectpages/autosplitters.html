        <h1 class="Headline">Autosplitters in C# for Competitive Speed Gaming</h1>
        <p>In late 2018, during downtime studying for my degree outside of work, a friend in a Discord server hinted he would love an autosplitter for a game he competed in playing quickly to get the best time finishing it. The autosplitter would track in-game conditions and split a stopwatch-like program, LiveSplit, and show his speed in completing objectives comparing his past attempts and showing a final total time taken to complete the game.</p>

                <h2>Description</h2>
                <p>This code was written in 2018 and represents the first real code I wrote that wasn't part of some tutorial. The route to complete the game changed when out-of-bounds behaviours were discoverd and movement tricks exploited leading to someone with more free time writing a new autosplitter to split for the new route.</p>

        <h3>Things I Learned</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Programming is pain.</li>
            <li>Never giving up leads to desired results, always.</li>
            <li>Well written documentation and comments are ecstacy. As seen in my verbose comments for my Turok 2 autosplitter intended to make it as easy as possible to modify for anyone.</li>
